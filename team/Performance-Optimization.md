1.**Lazy loading: Lazy loading is a technique for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage — especially images — until they are needed. Instead of loading everything all at once, known as "eager" loading, the browser does not request certain resources until the user interacts in such a way that the resources are needed. When implemented properly, lazy loading can speed up page load times.
2.**Eager loading: Eager loading is loading all webpage resources at the same time, or as soon as possible. Some applications that use eager loading may display a "Loading" screen. Complex, code-heavy web applications, such as online games, may prefer to use eager loading.
3.**Additional communication with the server: Instead of requesting all the page content at once, the browser might have to send multiple requests to the website's servers for content as the user interacts with the page.
4.**Additional code for the browser to process: If a developer adds several lines of JavaScript to a webpage to tell the browser how to lazy load page resources, this adds to the amount of code that the browser has to load and process.
